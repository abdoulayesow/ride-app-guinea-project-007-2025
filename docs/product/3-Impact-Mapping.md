## What is Impact Mapping?

Impact Mapping is a strategic planning technique that helps us connect our product features to real business goals through a clear chain of reasoning:

1. **GOAL** - Why are we doing this? (Business objective)
2. **ACTORS** - Who can help us achieve this goal? Who might prevent it?
3. **IMPACTS** - How should their behavior change?
4. **DELIVERABLES** - What can we build to support those impacts?

This document maps our path from business goals to specific product features, ensuring every deliverable contributes to measurable outcomes.

## Conclusion

This Impact Map provides a clear chain of reasoning from business goals to product features:

**GOAL** → We need 10,000 riders and 500 drivers  
**ACTORS** → These specific people can help us achieve it  
**IMPACTS** → If they change behavior in these ways  
**DELIVERABLES** → Then we should build these features

Every feature request should answer: "Which Impact does this support? Which Actor does this serve? How does this help achieve our Goal?"

Features that don't clearly map to an Impact should be deprioritized or reconsidered.

This living document will evolve as we learn which Impacts actually drive our Goal, allowing us to double down on what works and cut what doesn't.
