# Rider Personas

## Persona 1: Aminata Diallo

### Basic Profile
- **Age:** 24 years old
- **Occupation:** University student studying Business Administration
- **Location:** Lives in Hamdallaye neighborhood, studies at Université Gamal Abdel Nasser
- **Tech Comfort:** Medium - Uses WhatsApp, Instagram, Orange Money on Android phone
- **Income Level:** Low - Receives 500,000 GNF/month from family for living expenses
- **Languages:** French (fluent), Susu (native), some English

### Background Story
Aminata is in her third year studying Business Administration. She lives with her family in Hamdallaye but spends most of her day at university in another part of Conakry. Her daily commute is a constant source of stress—shared taxis don't run on predictable schedules, and she often waits 30+ minutes at taxi stands. When she has evening study groups, she relies on her older brother to pick her up because she doesn't feel safe taking taxis alone after dark.

She's comfortable with technology and uses Orange Money to receive her monthly allowance from her parents and to pay for mobile data. She's heard about Uber from friends who studied abroad but has never experienced an app-based ride service herself.

### Goals
- Get to university on time for 8 AM classes without depending on family schedule
- Return home safely after evening study sessions (often ending at 9-10 PM)
- Spend less time waiting for shared taxis during peak hours
- Pay using Orange Money to avoid carrying cash (safety concern)
- Know the price before the trip starts (shared taxis often overcharge students)

### Frustrations
- Shared taxis don't run regular schedules and are often overcrowded (4-5 people squeezed in back seat)
- Feels unsafe taking taxis alone at night, especially with male drivers she doesn't know
- No way to know taxi prices beforehand—drivers charge whatever they want, often 50-100% markup for students
- Cannot easily describe her exact pickup location (neighborhood doesn't have street names)
- Has to carry cash for taxis but worries about theft
- Missed important exams twice because she couldn't get a taxi on time

### Behaviors
- Checks WhatsApp constantly (main communication channel)
- Uses Orange Money 3-4 times per week for small purchases
- Prefers brands and services recommended by friends
- Shares money-saving tips with university friends
- Plans her day around transportation constraints (won't schedule anything after 7 PM unless family can drive her)

- **Income Level:** Middle class - 8,000,000 GNF/month
- **Languages:** French (fluent), Malinké (native), English (business level)

### Background Story
Mamadou manages equipment suppliers for multiple mining companies across West Africa. His job requires frequent travel to Conakry airport for regional flights, meetings with suppliers at industrial sites outside the city, and client dinners at restaurants across Conakry. 

He owns a car but his wife uses it daily for her business (she runs a boutique in Kaloum). This means Mamadou often needs transportation on short notice for business meetings. He currently relies on a personal driver (a friend's brother) who isn't always available, or he takes taxis and tries to negotiate business rates—a process he finds inefficient and unprofessional.

His company reimburses transportation expenses but requires digital receipts, which cash taxi drivers cannot provide. He's traveled extensively to Nigeria, Senegal, and Côte d'Ivoire and has used Uber/Bolt in those markets, wondering why nothing similar exists in Guinea.

### Goals

- Track business transportation expenses automatically with digital receipts
- Book rides to industrial areas outside central Conakry where taxi drivers often refuse to go
- Use mobile money for seamless digital payments

### Frustrations
- Cannot reliably book taxis in advance for early morning airport trips (5-6 AM flights)
- Difficulty tracking transportation spending for monthly expense reports to company
- Taxi drivers unfamiliar with industrial zones outside the city get lost frequently
- No digital receipt system for company reimbursement (has to estimate and justify cash expenses)
- Negotiations with taxi drivers waste time and feel unprofessional
- His personal driver isn't always available on short notice
- Shared taxis are overcrowded and inappropriate for business attire

### Behaviors
- Books flights weeks in advance, wants same reliability for ground transport
- Uses mobile money for most transactions (Orange Money premium user)
- Maintains detailed expense spreadsheet for company reimbursement
- Values time highly—will pay premium to avoid waiting or uncertainty
- Researches solutions online before making purchasing decisions
- Recommends good services to business network
- Uses WhatsApp Business for work communications

# Driver Personas

## Persona 3: Ibrahim Touré

### Basic Profile
- **Age:** 32 years old
- **Occupation:** Full-time taxi driver, owns his vehicle (2015 Toyota Corolla)
- **Location:** Lives in Matoto, drives throughout Conakry
- **Tech Comfort:** Medium - Uses basic Android phone (256GB storage, 2GB RAM), familiar with Orange Money
- **Income Level:** Variable - Earns 3,000,000-5,000,000 GNF/month depending on rides (after fuel/maintenance)
- **Languages:** French (good), Susu (native), Pular (conversational)
- **Family:** Married with 3 children (ages 3, 6, 9)

### Background Story
Ibrahim has been driving taxis in Conakry for 8 years. He bought his Toyota on a 3-year loan (now paid off) and supports his family entirely on taxi income. His wife stays home with their three children—the oldest just started primary school.

Ibrahim's daily routine: wakes at 5 AM, drives to busy taxi stand near university by 6 AM, waits 1-2 hours for first passenger, makes 8-12 trips throughout the day, returns home around 8 PM exhausted. Some days he earns 200,000 GNF, other days only 80,000 GNF. This income unpredictability creates financial stress—some months he struggles to afford fuel, school fees, and groceries simultaneously.

He knows the city well but struggles with new developments and industrial areas without clear landmarks. Passengers often give vague directions ("near the big mosque in Ratoma") and get frustrated when he can't find the exact location. He's heard about app-based driving from a cousin in Abidjan but worries about the commission fees eating into his already thin margins.

### Goals
- Increase number of daily trips from 8-12 to 15-20 (more consistent income)
- Reduce time spent waiting at taxi stands (idle time = no income)
- Get paid reliably at end of each day (cash flow critical for family expenses)
- Find passengers during slow afternoon hours (1-4 PM is typically dead time)
- Build savings to purchase a second vehicle (employ another driver)
- Provide stable income for family (children's education is priority)

### Frustrations
- Unpredictable daily income creates financial instability (can't plan expenses)
- Wastes 3-4 hours daily at taxi stands waiting for passengers
- Burns expensive fuel driving around looking for passengers during slow periods
- Some passengers refuse to pay agreed-upon fares (no recourse)
- Cannot afford high platform commission fees like international apps (heard Uber takes 25%)
- Struggles to find exact addresses when passengers give unclear directions
- Vehicle maintenance expensive—one major repair could wipe out month's savings
- Young passengers often try to negotiate unfairly low prices

### Behaviors
- Starts work early (5-6 AM) to catch university students and office workers
- Returns to same taxi stands where he has regular customers
- Knows all the "tricks"—where to find passengers at different times of day
- Uses Orange Money to send money to wife daily (she manages household budget)
- Saves aggressively—dreams of owning multiple vehicles
- Belongs to informal taxi driver association (they share ride tips, warn about problem passengers)
- Maintains vehicle carefully (can't afford to be off road for repairs)

- **Family:** Single, lives with younger sister who is also a student

### Background Story
Fatoumata teaches at a primary school in Dixinn from 7 AM to 1 PM. She loves teaching but the salary doesn't cover her expenses and her younger sister's university fees. Her family owns a small car (shared among siblings), but it often sits unused in the evenings and weekends since most family members work during the day.

A friend suggested she could earn extra money driving passengers during her free time. Fatoumata likes the idea of flexible income but has concerns as a female driver in a male-dominated industry. She's heard stories of harassment and safety issues. She's tech-savvy—uses Instagram, manages school class WhatsApp groups, and pays for everything with Orange Money. She wants a platform that would provide safety features and allow her to choose when she works.

She's never driven commercially before but is confident in her driving skills (learned to drive at 18, drives daily). She sees this as a temporary income boost until her sister graduates—then she can focus fully on her teaching career and possibly open a private tutoring center.

- Concerned male passengers might not respect female driver
- No support system for female drivers in traditional taxi industry
- Full-time taxi drivers might resent part-time driver "taking their income"

### Behaviors
- Very active on social media (Instagram, Facebook, teacher WhatsApp groups)

- Saves diligently (has clear financial goals)
- Prioritizes safety and reputation (both important for teaching career)
- Researches thoroughly before trying new things

---

## Conclusion

These four personas represent our core users in Guinea's ride-hailing market. Success requires serving all four simultaneously:

- **Aminata** needs safety and affordability
- **Mamadou** needs professionalism and efficiency
- **Ibrahim** needs income growth and daily payouts
- **Fatoumata** needs flexibility and safety features

The platform that serves all four wins the market. The platform that optimizes for only one or two fails.
